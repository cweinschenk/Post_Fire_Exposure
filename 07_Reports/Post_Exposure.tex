\setcounter{page}{1}

Fire investigators arrive on the fire scene after the fire is extinguished and the IDLH hazards are mitigated.  However, there are still sufficient physical and chemical hazards at the fire scene. 
 <<Fire  examining a scene several days after the fire, when the air seems safe.>>

The IAAI has defined catagories of fire scenes based on the post-fire extinguishment time and has recommended PPE protection for each time period based on the potential hazard that may exist~\cite{IAAI:2020}.   

\begin{enumerate}
\item HOT SCENE A – A fire scene where the fire has been extinguished, but overhaul has not yet commenced or is in progress.

\item HOT SCENE B – A fire scene that has been fully extinguished/overhauled for less than two hours.

\item  WARM SCENE – A fire scene that has been fully extinguished at least two hours but for less than 72 hours. 

\item COLD SCENE – A fire scene that has been fully extinguished for at least 72 hours and not generating detectable or visible dust, fumes, mists, particulates, gases, vapors or aerosols.

\end{enumerate}




\section{Objectives}

To improve the health and safety of fire investigators by understanding the risk for solid phase and vapor phase chemical exposures at the post-fire scene.  The environment from a single family residential structure fire were be sampled at several fixed time periods after the fire. Time of sampling ranged from just after fire extinguishment to 5 days after the fire.  These experiments will characterize the baseline conditions of air-borne contaminants in a residental fire scene with respect to time.

\chapter{Measurement Approach}

Area monitoring devices are set up either in the kitchen/living room area or a bedroom depending on the area of origin of the fire.  Samples for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aldehydes, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, VOCs (particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX)), fibers and a variety of metals are being collected.

\subsection{Measurement Uncertainty}
\label{subsec:uncertainty}

\textit{\hl{Note: this template contains uncertainty information for a variety of different measurement types. Be sure to remove any types that aren't mentioned.}} 

\textit{\hl{Additionally, although this section provides information about measurement uncertainty in paragraphs that are sufficient for a technical report,}\textbf{\hl{ it's highly recommended that the content obtained from this section is still reviewed after being copied to a technical report to verify the accuracy and applicability of the information.}}\hl{For example, it should be verified that the instrumentation described in the paragraphs below resemble the same type used during the experiments mentioned in the technical report.}}

There are different components of uncertainty in the measured values reported in this document, specifically gas temperature, total heat flux, pressure, gas velocity, gas concentration, heat release rate, length, mass, structure leakage, and water flow rate. Uncertainties are grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate them. Type A uncertainties are those evaluated by statistical methods, and Type B are those evaluated by other means~\cite{Taylor&Kuyatt:1994}. Type B analysis of systematic uncertainties involves estimating the upper ($+$~a) and lower ($-$~a) limits for the quantity in question such that the probability that the value would be in the interval ($\pm$~a) is essentially 100~\%. After estimating uncertainties by either Type A or B analysis, the uncertainties can be combined in quadrature to yield the combined standard uncertainty. Multiplying this combined standard uncertainty by a coverage factor of two results in an expanded uncertainty with a 95~\% confidence interval (2$\sigma$). For some components, such as the zero and calibration elements, uncertainties were derived from referenced instrument specifications. For other components, referenced research results and past experience with the instruments provided input for the uncertainty determination.

\subsubsection*{Gas Temperature}
According to Omega Engineering, the manufacturer of the thermocouple wire utilized during the experiments, the standard uncertainty in the temperature of the thermocouple wire itself is $\pm$~2.2~$^\circ$C at 277~$^\circ$C and $\pm$~9.5~$^\circ$C at 871~$^\circ$C~\cite{Omega:2004}. In addition to the uncertainty of the sensor itself, radiative effects to the thermocouple should be considered. Several studies have attempted to quantify these effects on thermocouple measurement uncertainty in compartment fires~\cite{Blevins:1999,Pitts:2003}. These studies indicated that when the thermocouple is located in the upper gas layer, the actual temperature of the surrounding gas is typically higher than the measured temperature, although this difference is not as pronounced as when the thermocouple is in the lower layer. When the thermocouple is in the lower layer, particularly during a fully involved compartment fire, the percent error in measured temperature can be much larger. Because of these radiative contributions, the expanded total uncertainty is estimated as $\pm$~15~\%.

\subsubsection*{Heat Flux}
The manufacturer of the heat flux gauges, Medtherm Corporation, reports a $\pm$~3~\% calibration expanded uncertainty for the devices~\cite{Medtherm:2003}. Results from an international study on total heat flux gauge calibration and response demonstrated that the total expanded uncertainty of a Schmidt-Boelter gauge is typically $\pm$~8~\%~\cite{Pitts:2006}.

\subsubsection*{Pressure}
Differential pressure reading uncertainty components were derived from pressure transducer instrument specifications and previous experience with pressure transducers. Each transducer was factory calibrated by the manufacturer to verify that the zero and span of the transducer resulted in an accuracy of $\pm$~1~\%~\cite{Setra:2002}. The total expanded uncertainty associated with the pressure data from these experiments is estimated to be $\pm$~10~\%.

\subsubsection*{Gas Velocity}
A gas velocity measurement study that focused on flow through doorways during pre-flashover compartment fires yielded total expanded uncertainties ranging from $\pm$~14~\% to $\pm$~22~\% for measurements from BDPs similar to those used throughout the experiments described in this report~\cite{Bryant:FSJ2009}. The total expanded uncertainty for gas velocity measured during these experiments is estimated to be $\pm$~18~\%.

\subsubsection*{Gas Concentration}
The oxygen concentration measurement range of the OxyMat6 was 0--25~\%. The gas sampling instruments used throughout the experiments described in this report have demonstrated a relative expanded uncertainty of $\pm$~1~\% when compared to span gas volume fractions~\cite{Bundy:2007}. According to a study by Lock~et~al.~\cite{Lock:1}, the non-uniformities and movement of exhaust gases in addition to the limited amount of sampling points considered in each experiment result in an estimated expanded uncertainty of $\pm$~12~\%.

\subsubsection*{Heat Release Rate}
\hl{Will depend upon technique used to measure HRR. Need to specify fuels for which HRR was characterized.} 

To understand the energy release of the fuel loads (i.e., the primary ignition source) used in these experiments, fuels were burned in Underwriters Laboratory's oxygen consumption calorimetry laboratory in Northbrook, Ill was The oxygen consumption calorimeter is sized to handle up to a 10~MW fire with a 31~ft (9.4~m) diameter conical hood. In a previous study, Bryant and Mullholland~\cite{Bryant:FM2008} estimated the uncertainty of oxygen consumption calorimeters measuring high heat release rate fires at $\pm$~11\%. They identified several sources of error within the calorimeter, with one of the primary sources being the uncertainty in the gas concentration measurements.

\subsubsection*{Length}
Length measurements, such as the room dimensions and instrumentation locations, were made with either a hand held laser measurement device having an accuracy of 0.25~in. ($\pm$~6.0~mm) over a range of 2~ft (0.6~m) to 50~ft (15.2~m)~\cite{StanleyTools} or $\pm$~0.02~in. ($\pm$~0.51~mm) resolution steel measuring tapes manufactured in compliance with NIST Manual 44~\cite{Butcher:2012}, which specifies a tolerance of $\pm$~0.06~in. ($\pm$~1.5~mm) for 30~ft (9.1~m) tapes and $\pm$~0.25~in. ($\pm$~6.4~mm) for 100~ft (30.5~m) tapes. These uncertainties are all well within the precision of the reported dimensions, which are typically rounded to the nearest inch. Some issues, such as levelness of the device and ``soft'' edges on upholstered furniture, result in an estimated expanded uncertainty of $\pm$~1.0~\% for reported length measurements.

\subsubsection*{Mass}
The load cell used to weigh the fuels prior to the experiments had a range of 0~lb (0~kg) to 441~lb (200~kg) with a resolution of 0.11~lb (0.05~kg) and a calibration uncertainty within 1~\%~\cite{Ohaus:2000}. The total expanded uncertainty for the fuel weights measured by the load cell that are presented in this report is estimated to be less than $\pm$~5~\%.

\subsubsection*{Structure Leakage} 
To characterize ventilation within the structure, an air leakage measurement system (Model~5101) was used to measure the amount of leakage associated with the training prop before each test~\cite{retrotec:leakage}. \textit{ASTM~E779-10, Standard Test Method for Determining Air Leakage Rate by Fan Pressurization} was followed to determine the air leakage rate of the prop before each experiment~\cite{astm_e779}. The measured leakage rates were recorded in units of air changes per hour at 50~Pa (ACPH50). Retrotec, the manufacturer of the leakage measurement system, reports an accuracy of $\pm$~5~\% for the system.

\subsubsection*{Water Flow Rate}
Water flow rate was measured with a 1.5~in. (3.8~cm) diameter electromagnetic flow meter from Badger Meter, Inc. (Model~M2000). The meter consisted of stainless steel pipe lined with a non-conductive material. Energized coils on the outside of the non-conductive material imposed a magnetic field across the pipe, and when the conductive fluid (water) flowed across the magnetic field, a voltage proportional to flow velocity was produced. The manufacturer reports a $\pm$~0.25~\% calibration uncertainty for the accuracy of the measurement~\cite{Badger:2015}.
